# OpenClaw NV Autonomous Experiments

Public case-study release for auditable LLM-agent workflows in NV-center
experiments.

This repository is organized around sanitized copies of completed OpenClaw
project folders, together with the MATLAB/Python analysis code and data needed
to inspect the runs. The release preserves agent state, bridge records,
evidence, figures, reports, and analysis artifacts from completed
autonomous-agent runs.

## Public Scope

The case-referenced OpenClaw/NV project-management source is public for audit.

This repository cannot control hardware.

Real completed case artifacts are included.

See [docs/public_scope.md](docs/public_scope.md) for the exact public boundary.

## Start Here

For a quick review, read these in order:

1. [System overview](docs/system_overview.md)
2. [Case walkthrough](docs/case_walkthrough.md)
3. [image172647 case README](cases/image172647/README.md)
4. [image145844 case README](cases/image145844/README.md)
5. [image231924 case README](cases/image231924/README.md)
6. [Code inventory](docs/code_inventory.md)
7. [Safety boundary](docs/safety_boundary.md)

## What This Repository Shows

- A safety-bounded LLM research agent operating real NV-center experiments.
- Deterministic MATLAB bridge records for experiment validation and execution.
- Human-readable project state, evidence logs, and closeout reports.
- pODMR, Ramsey, CPMG, drift, and model-comparison analyses from completed runs.
- Three completed case studies: `image145844`, `image172647`, and
  `image231924`.

| [image172647](cases/image172647/README.md) | Fresh re-image recovery, pODMR candidate rejection/acceptance, multi-detuning Ramsey, CPMG N=8 nearby-13C-like corroboration | Completed |
| [image231924](cases/image231924/README.md) | Aligned NV selection, pODMR center refinement, corrected-center Ramsey, T2star closeout | Completed |

sources and treatments are tracked in
[SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md](SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md).

## Safety Boundary

Public code paths are analysis-only by default. Instrument control, stage
motion, microwave output, and live bridge queue mutation are not included as
public execution entry points.

Hardware credentials, private laboratory configuration, and queue execution
settings are intentionally excluded.

The included `python/openclaw_nv_execution_source` directory exposes the
case-referenced project-management execution source for audit. Direct execution
entry points are disabled in the public release. The live MATLAB lab backend
source is not included; historical bridge records are included as case
artifacts.

Project folders are intended to be close mirrors of the original public
case-study folders. Redactions are limited to safety/privacy sanitization and
redistribution constraints.

Before publishing or pushing new case artifacts, run:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\check_public_release_redactions.ps1
```

Copied artifacts should be recorded in `SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md`.

## License

Code is licensed under the MIT License. Documentation, public case-study
folders, included data exports, generated figures, reports, and analysis
artifacts are licensed under CC BY 4.0. See `LICENSE`.

## Reproducibility

The included case artifacts are intended to support analysis review and
rebuilding of selected figures, metrics, and reports. Full live laboratory
re-execution is outside the scope of this public release.

# OpenClaw NV Autonomous Experiments

## Overview

Public release for auditable LLM-agent workflows in NV-center experiments.

This repository has two parallel parts:

- **Case studies:** sanitized completed OpenClaw project folders from real
  autonomous-agent NV experiments.
- **Benchmarks:** offline pODMR resonance-classification tests that evaluate
  how prompt context and reasoning effort change agent judgment on raw NV
  measurements.

The release preserves project state, evidence logs, bridge records, figures,
reports, analysis artifacts, benchmark inputs, labels, predictions, per-run
analysis notes, and scoring scripts needed to inspect the results.

## Public Scope

The case-referenced OpenClaw/NV project-management source is public for audit.

This repository cannot control hardware.

Real completed case artifacts are included.

See [docs/public_scope.md](docs/public_scope.md) for the exact public boundary.

## Repository Contents

| Part | What It Shows | Main Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Case studies | A safety-bounded LLM research agent operating real NV-center experiments | Project state, evidence logs, bridge records, figures, reports, pODMR/Ramsey/CPMG analyses |

| Source and docs | Public audit boundary for OpenClaw/NV project management and analysis | Python/MATLAB analysis code, public runtime source, system docs, safety notes |

## Case Studies

The case studies are completed OpenClaw/NV project runs. They are intended to
show what the agent saw, what it decided, which artifacts it wrote, and how the
final scientific conclusions were bounded by the evidence.

| Case | Summary | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [image145844](cases/image145844/README.md) | Aligned NV selection, pODMR screening, repeated Ramsey diagnostics, shifted-sideband 13C candidate reanalysis | Completed |
| [image172647](cases/image172647/README.md) | Fresh re-image recovery, pODMR candidate rejection/acceptance, multi-detuning Ramsey, CPMG N=8 nearby-13C-like corroboration | Completed |
| [image231924](cases/image231924/README.md) | Aligned NV selection, pODMR center refinement, corrected-center Ramsey, T2star closeout | Completed |

## Benchmarks

The benchmark is an offline resonance-classification test built from pODMR data.
It asks the agent to decide whether a resonance is present from one case at a
time using raw export JSON files, raw-readout figures, and prompt context.

| Benchmark | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [pODMR model-first resonance benchmark](benchmarks/podmr-model-first-resonance-2026-05/README.md) | 96 single-case pODMR classifications with prompts, raw inputs, labels, predictions, analysis notes, and scoring scripts |

The pODMR benchmark contains 24 resonance-present and 72 resonance-absent
strong-pi measurements. Each prompt condition was run for three replicates with
GPT-5.5 at four reasoning-effort settings: `low`, `medium`, `high`, and
`xhigh`.

The three prompt conditions are:

| Condition | Description |
| --- | --- |
| XML only | Uses the raw export, raw-readout figure, and sequence XML. |
| Domain facts | Adds compact NV-domain facts such as contrast scale, mod-depth/Rabi scaling, and average interpretation. |
| Model-first | Adds a requirement to establish the expected signal with a simulation or explicit quantitative model calculation before judging resonance presence. |

The main trend is that higher reasoning effort alone can increase
false-positive resonance calls, while the model-first condition suppresses
false positives across reasoning-effort settings without introducing false
negatives in this dataset. Full predictions, per-run analysis notes, and scoring
tables are included under
[benchmarks/podmr-model-first-resonance-2026-05/results](benchmarks/podmr-model-first-resonance-2026-05/results).

| Reasoning | XML-only FPR | Domain-facts FPR | Model-first FPR |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| low | 14.81% | 6.94% | 3.70% |
| medium | 32.87% | 9.26% | 0.46% |
| high | 44.44% | 12.04% | 0.46% |
| xhigh | 53.24% | 6.48% | 0.46% |

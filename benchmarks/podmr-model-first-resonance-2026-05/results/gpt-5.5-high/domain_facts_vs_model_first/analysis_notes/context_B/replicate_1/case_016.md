Case: podmr_001_2026-05-16-000631

Sequence inspection:
- SequenceName is Rabimodulated.xml.
- The active measurement path is: polarize, detection, wait, rabi_pulse_mod_wait_time, detection, wait.
- readout 1 is the true mS=0 optical reference acquired immediately after polarization.
- full_expt = 0, so the optional mS=+1 reference block is inactive despite do_adiabatic_inversion being true.
- readout 2 is the pODMR signal after the microwave Rabi pulse.
- mod_depth = 1 from the provided sequence variables.
- length_rabi_pulse = 52 ns; at sample_rate = 250 MHz this is 13 samples and remains 52 ns.

Physical model calculation:
- Given Rabi frequency about 10 MHz at mod_depth = 1, use f_R = 10 MHz.
- For a rectangular resonant pulse, population transfer is P(delta) =
  f_R^2/(f_R^2 + delta^2) * sin^2(pi * tau * sqrt(f_R^2 + delta^2)),
  with tau = 52 ns and detuning delta in Hz.
- On resonance, P(0) = sin^2(pi * 10e6 * 52e-9) = 0.996.
- With the stated 22% mS=0 to mS=+1 contrast scale, the expected resonant fractional fluorescence drop is
  0.22 * 0.996 = 0.219, or about 8.3 counts for a 38-count baseline.

Data comparison:
- The outer-point median readout 2 baseline is 37.71 counts.
- The minimum readout 2 value is 28.98 counts at 3.880 GHz, a drop of 8.73 counts or 23.2%.
- Normalizing by the same-shot mS=0 reference, readout2/readout1 reaches a minimum of 0.7804 at 3.880 GHz, i.e. a 21.96% drop from unity.
- A two-level Rabi line-shape fit to readout2/readout1 using f_R = 10 MHz and tau = 52 ns gives center 3.87727 GHz, baseline ratio 0.9986, and fitted contrast amplitude 0.2297. This is close to the expected 0.219 contrast from the model.
- A constant-ratio model has SSE 0.1111, while the fixed-pulse Rabi line-shape fit has SSE 0.0241.

Decision:
The measured dip amplitude and frequency-localized shape match the explicit Rabi-pulse pODMR expectation for this sequence, so a pODMR resonance is present.

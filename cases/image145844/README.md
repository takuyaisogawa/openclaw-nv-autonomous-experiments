# Case: image145844

Latest completed case study for an aligned NV candidate selected from the
`image145844` region, including pODMR screening, Ramsey follow-up, and revised
13C sideband reanalysis.

## Reading Summary

The agent rejected fresh `r01` and `r02` for alignment selection after
raw/readout-aware pODMR reviews did not show clear usable resonances. It
accepted `r03` after strong-pi and weak-pi pODMR evidence, then ran multiple
Ramsey branches with changed measurement conditions rather than blind repeats.

The final revised closeout is
[image145844_reimage_r03_shifted_sideband_recloseout_report_20260514_1320.pdf](project/work/artifacts/reports/20260514_1320_r03_shifted_sideband_recloseout/image145844_reimage_r03_shifted_sideband_recloseout_report_20260514_1320.pdf).

Final claim boundary: aligned `r03` found; no unconditional claim-grade numeric
T2star; plausible nearby-13C shifted-sideband candidate evidence conditional on
a residual carrier shift, not an independently confirmed coupling claim.

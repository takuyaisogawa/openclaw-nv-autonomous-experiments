# Case: image172647

Completed aligned-NV case study with fresh re-imaging after a stale-candidate
failure, pODMR-based candidate rejection/acceptance, weak-pi center refinement,
multi-detuning Ramsey follow-up, and CPMG N=8 corroboration of a weak
nearby-13C-like signature.

## Reading Summary

The agent began from the `image172647` saved image, but the first candidate
became low-count/stale before useful pODMR data could be acquired. It performed
a fresh re-image of the original region, rejected `reimage1804_c01` after a
healthy but no-clear-resonance strong-pi pODMR scan, and accepted
`reimage1804_c02` after a clear signal-only strong-pi pODMR resonance.

The accepted branch then proceeded through weak-pi pODMR center refinement,
three Ramsey datasets at different programmed detunings, and a CPMG N=8 tau
scan designed as an independent discriminator for the weak 13C-like candidate.

Final claim boundary: aligned `reimage1804_c02` found; T2star is supported as a
short/few-us order, about `2-3 us` but method-sensitive; the data support a
likely weak/moderate nearby-13C-like signature from det-shift Ramsey plus CPMG
target-region corroboration, but not precise coupling extraction or a
publication-grade single-spin claim.

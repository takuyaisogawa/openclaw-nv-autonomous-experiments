# System Overview

OpenClaw is organized as an auditable autonomous-experiment loop. The public
release exposes the current project-management source and completed project
records.

## Core Objects

`project state` is the compact current truth for a project. In the case
copies, the readable form is `work/state.md`; machine state and audit records
live under `.manager/`.

`backlog` is an execution queue and audit trail, not the full scientific plan.
It captures bounded work items, external blockers, and completed decisions.

`memory / knowledge` separates wake-start operating rules from accumulated
domain lessons. In the live system, memory routes the agent to the relevant
knowledge sections instead of loading every prior lesson into every wake.

`experiment intent` is the agent-authored scientific plan before any bridge
touch. It records the objective, submit spec, safety assumptions, expected
evidence, and verification status.

`evidence ledger` is append-only provenance. It links analysis outputs, figures,
bridge results, notes, and reports to the claims they support or reject.

## Wake Loop

The scheduler inspects project state, bridge/result activity, backlog, and
recent agent-run records. If work is actionable, it writes a wake record and
dispatches the project agent. The public cases preserve the wake records and
the retained project-manager source at
`python/openclaw_nv_execution_source/nv_project_manager.py`; scheduler startup
wiring is outside this focused public subset.

## Backend Boundary

The public repository cannot move stages, emit microwave signals, start lasers,
control cameras, or mutate a live bridge queue. Execution-source entry points
are disabled, and private configuration/live queue roots are excluded.

Completed case folders preserve real historical bridge/result artifacts for
audit.
